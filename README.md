# Bash Configuration

![bash shell screenshot](lobashrc.png)  

To use this configuration, copy and paste the contents in my .bashrc to your local .bashrc file.  
The default path to .bashrc on Linux is:
```/home/[user]/.bashrc```

Read code comments and change colors and icons to your liking, or keep my defaults!
